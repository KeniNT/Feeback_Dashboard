# Feeback_Dashboard
This project is a full-stack web application that allows users to submit feedback and helps admins analyze the collected responses. The system includes a feedback submission form, a dashboard to view all entries, and basic analytics such as total feedbacks, average rating, and positive/negative feedback distribution.

The application is built using React (frontend), Node.js & Express (backend), and MongoDB Atlas (database). It supports features like feedback filtering, searching, and exporting responses to CSV. The entire app is deployed using cloud platforms (Render for backend and Vercel for frontend).
